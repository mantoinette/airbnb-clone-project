### 🏘️ Property Management
Enables hosts to list properties, upload images, add descriptions, set pricing, and manage availability. This feature ensures that users can effectively showcase and update their accommodations.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to search for properties, view availability, and make bookings. It ensures date validation, price calculation, and real-time updates to avoid double-bookings.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles payment transactions associated with bookings. It supports different payment methods and maintains transaction history to ensure transparency and trust between users.

### ⭐ Review & Rating System
Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings after completing a stay. This promotes quality control, trust, and accountability between hosts and guests.

### 🔎 Search and Filter
Allows users to search properties based on location, price, availability, and ratings. This enhances the user experience by making it easier to find relevant listings quickly.

### 🔐 Security & Authorization
Implements features like hashed passwords, JWT tokens (or sessions), and access controls. This ensures that only authorized users can access or modify data relevant to their roles.
