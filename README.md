# Airbnb Clone Project

This project replicates the core functionalities of a real-world accommodation booking platform, such as Airbnb. It allows users to list, discover, and book properties while ensuring secure transactions and data integrity.

---

## Features

This project replicates the core functionalities of a real-world accommodation booking platform, such as Airbnb. Each feature is designed to provide a smooth and secure experience for users, hosts, and administrators.

### 👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system securely handles user authentication and role-based access, enabling users to act as either guests or hosts.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Enables hosts to list properties, upload images, add descriptions, set pricing, and manage availability. This feature ensures that users can effectively showcase and update their accommodations.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to search for properties, view availability, and make bookings. It ensures date validation, price calculation, and real-time updates to avoid double-bookings.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles payment transactions associated with bookings. It supports different payment methods and maintains transaction history to ensure transparency and trust between users.

### ⭐ Review & Rating System
Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings after completing a stay. This promotes quality control, trust, and accountability between hosts and guests.

### 🔎 Search and Filter
Allows users to search properties based on location, price, availability, and ratings. This enhances the user experience by making it easier to find relevant listings quickly.

### 🔐 Security & Authorization
Implements features like hashed passwords, JWT tokens (or sessions), and access controls. This ensures that only authorized users can access or modify data relevant to their roles.

## Feature Breakdown

The project includes a set of core features that enable users and hosts to interact with the platform effectively. Below is a detailed breakdown of each major feature and its role in the system.

### 👤 User Management
Handles user registration, login, and profile updates. It supports secure authentication and role-based access control (e.g., host or guest).

### 🏘️ Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Listings include details such as title, description, price, location, and images.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It prevents date conflicts and calculates the total cost based on the price per night and stay duration.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Processes payments tied to bookings. It records payment status, method, and timestamps, ensuring secure and trackable transactions.

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
Lets users leave reviews and ratings after a completed stay. This promotes accountability and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 🔎 Search and Filter
Enables guests to search and filter properties by location, price, and availability. Improves user experience by narrowing down relevant results.

### 🔐 Security
Implements authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect user data and system integrity.

## API Security

API security is vital for protecting user data, handling payments safely, and maintaining the trust and integrity of the platform. The following measures have been implemented:

### 🔐 Authentication
The system uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity. This ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints.

**Why it matters:**  
Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or manipulating data.

---

### 🛂 Authorization
Role-based access control restricts actions based on user roles (guest, host, admin). Each user can only perform operations allowed by their access level.

**Why it matters:**  
Ensures users cannot access or modify data that doesn't belong to them.

---

### 📈 Rate Limiting
API endpoints are protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks.

**Why it matters:**  
Helps maintain performance and fairness, while protecting the system from overload.

---

### 🔍 Input Validation & Data Sanitization
User input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection-based attacks.

**Why it matters:**  
Preserves data integrity and protects the platform from common web vulnerabilities.

---

### 🔒 Secure Payments
Sensitive data during transactions is handled securely using HTTPS and tokenization. No raw payment information is stored on the server.

**Why it matters:**  
Protects users from financial fraud and unauthorized access to payment data.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** pipeline is a set of automated processes that allow teams to build, test, and deploy code quickly and reliably. It ensures that any changes pushed to the codebase go through a series of checks before being released to production.

### 🚀 Why CI/CD Is Important
CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality by automating testing and integration tasks, reducing human error, and enabling faster delivery of new features and bug fixes. This is especially important in collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on different parts of the application.

### 🛠️ Tools Used or Recommended
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates testing, linting, and deployment directly from GitHub.
- **Docker** – Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render** – Platforms for deploying and hosting the application automatically after successful builds.
- **Pytest** – Used for writing and running automated tests during the CI phase.

By integrating these tools into a CI/CD pipeline, we ensure that every code change is validated and safely deployed, enhancing the stability and scalability of the project.
