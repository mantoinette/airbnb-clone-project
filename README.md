## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a variety of modern technologies to build a scalable and efficient web application. Each technology plays a specific role in the system:

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to develop the backend of the application. Django provides a robust structure for building secure and maintainable RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
An advanced open-source relational database system used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews. It offers reliability, strong performance, and powerful querying capabilities.

### 🔍 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs. GraphQL helps improve performance and flexibility in communication between the frontend and backend.

### 🐙 Git & GitHub
Git is a version control system used to track code changes, while GitHub is the platform used for hosting the repository and collaborating as a team.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 🚀 Heroku / AWS
Cloud platforms used to deploy the application and make it accessible online. They provide hosting infrastructure, database integration, and scalability options.

### 🧪 Pytest / Postman
Used for testing the backend services. Pytest enables automated testing of Django components, and Postman is used for testing API endpoints manually.
